# project overview
When thinking about community, one often finds the term associated with the closeness of people. Typically, it is seen in a positive and optimistic light. However, community can be found in relation to sad emotions and in this way it is often overlooked. Community can be seen in the sense of going through the same emotions as another, as all emotions (even painful or sad) can be felt by anyone. 

To depict this seemingly juxtaposed idea, the lyrics from "Thank You" by artist rum.gold were taken and transformed in various ways throughout the website. This song acts as a bittersweet sense of community. It acts to serve the message of being wronged by someone or something, yet still reflecting on the experience and how the past shaped you into your current self. Use of color and type manipulation within the site help to drive this idea that despite isolation or loneliness one may feel, they are never truly alone.

I believe that acknowledging our past, even difficult moments, can help us move into our futures. Despite any difficulties, they have shaped us into who we are and the theme of this song has definitely resonated with me throughout time.
